        How COVID-19 Impacted Taekwondo and How We Came Out Stronger

          The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to Taekwondo
          practitioners worldwide. With no offline events or competitions,
          practitioners were forced to adapt to a new way of training. The lack
          of community engagement and physical practice affected both their
          physical and mental well-being, while the absence of competitions led
          to frustration and a halt in training progress for many.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond training limitations, individuals and families faced economic
          hardships. Many lost jobs, and the sense of community Taekwondo
          fosters felt distant, leaving people isolated and facing difficult
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response, Grandmaster Han Wong saw an opportunity to keep the
          Taekwondo spirit alive and support those in need. By hosting online
          Taekwondo championships, practitioners could safely compete from home.
          This virtual format enabled them to showcase their skills, stay
          challenged, and remain connected to the global Taekwondo community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Registration fees from these championships were used to assist people
          impacted by the pandemic, covering medical, financial, and personal
          needs. This initiative combined competitive spirit with charitable
          action, bringing the community together and demonstrating the
          resilience and compassion within Taekwondo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the online championships continue to provide a platform for
          competition and support, a testament to Grandmaster Han Wong’s vision.
          His efforts not only preserved Taekwondo during the pandemic but also
          transformed adversity into an opportunity for solidarity and growth.
