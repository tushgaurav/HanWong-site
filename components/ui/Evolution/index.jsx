            Ancient Origins
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Taekwondo's history is rich, rooted in centuries of Korean martial
            arts tradition. Its origins can be traced to ancient Korean
            practices like Taekkyeon, which were used for self-defense and
            military purposes, shaping the foundation for modern Taekwondo.

            Formal Development
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-2">
            After World War II, Korean martial arts masters came together to
            unify their teachings, leading to the birth of Taekwondo. During the
            1940s and 1950s, the practice was refined in schools called "kwans,"
            each contributing to Taekwondo's techniques and philosophies. In
            1955, Taekwondo officially received its name, meaning "the way of
            the foot and fist."

            Global Expansion

          <p className="mt-2">
            The 1960s and 1970s marked the international spread of Taekwondo,
            driven by Korean expatriates, military personnel, and diplomats. The
            founding of the World Taekwondo Federation (WT) in 1973 and the
            International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) in 1966 laid the groundwork
            for global recognition.

          <p className="mt-2">
            A pivotal milestone came in 1988 when Taekwondo was included as a
            demonstration sport at the Seoul Olympics. Its success on this world
            stage helped secure Taekwondo's status, and by the 2000 Sydney
            Olympics, it was officially recognized as an Olympic sport, with
            athletes competing globally for Olympic gold.
